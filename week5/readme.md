# Loops: It is a block code that repeats itself. Counted or Definite loop, and indefinite loops
# Iteration: a repetition, one complete cycle
# While Loop
## Syntax:
	while (condition){
		statements
	}
## Semantics:
-	Evaluate the condition
-	If condition is true: Execute inner statements and repeat step 1
-	If Condition is false: End the loop

# Sentinel Value
- 	Sentinel Value is a value the while loop is always keeping an eye for, if the sentinel value is given then at the next iteration the loop will end

## Example
	while (n != -1){
		statements
		n=input
	}

# true
-	It will run forever until there is a breaking condition inside

## Example
	while( true ){
		statements
		if(condition){
			break;
		}
	}
# flag
- 	 a boolean variable  that is first set to true, and there is condition inside the loop that will change the value is this flag

## Example
	while(flag){
		statements
		if ( condition ){
			flag = false;
		}
	}
# Incrementing
-	this while loop has a condition that will change as the variable inside(counter) will change every iteration
 
## Example
 
	while(n < 100){
		statements
		n++;// same as n = n+1 ,  n +=1, 
	}

	while(n < 100){
		statements
		n += 10;// same as n = n+10 
	}
	

# Do while Loop
- This loop will at least repeat once without checking the condition

## Syntax:
	do {
		statements
	} while(condition);

## Semantics:
- 	Execute inner statements
- 	Check the while condition
-	If condition is true go to step 1
-	If condition is false end the loop

# For Loop
## Syntax:
	for (start; stop; step){
		statements
	} 
	
	start code:  initialization code
	stop code:  condition, if condition is false it will stop 
	step code: Incrementing code
## Semantics:
- 1.	Run start code for the first iteration only.
- 2. 	Check Stop condition
- 3. 	If condition is true execute inner statements. and then go to step code. go to step 2.
- 4.	If condition is false end the loop

## Example using accumulator pattern
	int sum = 0 ; 
	for ( int i = 1; i <= 10 ; i++){
		sum = sum + i; // sum += i
	}
	//1 + 2 = 3 + 3 = 6 + 4 = 10 + 5 = 15 +6 = 21 + 7 = 28 + 8 = 36 + 9 = 45 +10 = 55
# For Each Loop
	String [] names = {"Maria", "Azis", "Galin"};
	
	for ( String tempName : names ){
		System.out.println(tempName);
	}
